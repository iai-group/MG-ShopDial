<h4>Instructions</h4>

<div>
    The goal of the conversation is to have a rich discussion with a client who you will help and support in
    their shopping.
    You have three objectives for this task:
</div>

<ol type="1">
    <li>Determine what the client is looking for. If necessary, you can ask questions to clarify
        the client's need.</li>
    <li>Elicit the client's preferences to make the best suggestions possible.</li>
    <li>Answer factual and general questions about a specific item, property, brand, etc.</li>
</ol>

<!-- The first one is to determine what the client is looking for. If necessary, you
can ask questions to clarify the clientâ€™s need. The second is to elicit the client's preferences to make the best
suggestions possible. The third one is to answer factual and general questions about a specific item, property, brand, etc.
We want them to be curious about the recommended items and take a lot of turns to learn all the information necessary to help them make a decision. -->

<div>
    Below you have a checklist of what is expected for this conversation. Some items on the list are not necessarily
    in chronological order, like for example, answering factual questions. It is important to keep in mind that
    the conversation should be as natural as possible. If you don't understand what the client is saying, don't be
    afraid to ask questions. Also, we want the client to be curious about the recommended items and take a lot of turns
    to get all the information they need to make a decision on the items to buy. Feel free to give a short explanation
    on why you recommended a specific item.

    <p><strong>Do not hesitate to let the client know that you may take some time to answer their request. A pre-defined
            message
            is available below the message area.</strong></p>
