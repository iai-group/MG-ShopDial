The MG-ShopDial dataset contains English conversations that mix different conversational goals, including search, recommendation, and question answering in the domain of e-commerce. 
The dataset includes 64 high-quality dialogues with a total of 2,196 utterances for scenarios of varying complexity. Intents and goals annotations are available on the utterance level. 
In addition to MG-ShopDial, the data collection tool Coached Conversation Collector is released. This tool supports the proposed coached human-human data collection protocol used for the creation of MG-ShopDial.
